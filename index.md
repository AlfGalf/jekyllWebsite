My name is Alfie Richards (he/him). I'm a student at the University of Bath

-----------------

I love Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm especially interested in language 
design, operating systems, systems programming, compilers, functional 
programming, and LLVM.

I have experience with C#, Rust, Python, Swift, Haskell, C amongst others.

I am looking for opportunities in language design and tooling, especially 
compilation, and platform development.
