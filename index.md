<title>About</title>

I am a Graduate Engineer at Arm, I previously achieved an MSc in Computer Science
and Mathematics from the University of Bath.

Interests
-----------------

I'm especially interested in compilers, language
design, functional programming, proof assistants, and category theory.

I have experience with Rust, Python, Swift, Haskell, C amongst others.
I've worked as a web developer, compiler engineer, and app developer.
I've studies mostly logic and semantics of programming languages and
formal proofs.

Projects:
---------

### [Technical Labs](https://www.technical-labs.link/notes/2020/)

In 2020 as a student Joe Cryer and I wrote and published an educational series
of sessions and notes called Technical Labs. This was for BCSS and the
University of Bath computer science department. It aims to teach some
fundamental technical computer science skills. More details can be found
[here](https://bath-bcss.github.io/Technical-Labs/2020/) and the videos can be found
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT4sucrjsqF8kvZFcRvxfhWuTvjKrXYzE).

### [Incorectness Logic in Lean](https://github.com/AlfGalf/Incorrectness_Logic)

For my masters dissertation I formalised the Incorectness Logic results initiated by
O'Hearne. I used the lean theorem prover and managed to prove the soundness and completeness
results. This work was done with my supervisor [Guy McCusker](https://people.bath.ac.uk/gam23/) who
I remain extremely grateful for.

### More projects

For my degree I have worked on Lambda calculus reducers, compilers, interpreters, and more.
They are not available publicly as I don't publish
coursework solutions for obvious reasons.

A small list of other dubious quality and unmaintained projects can be found here
[here](https://github.com/AlfGalf?tab=repositories).
